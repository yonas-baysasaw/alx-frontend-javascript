## Project Overview

This repository covers practical frontend JavaScript exercises with an emphasis on TypeScript, module bundling, linting, and configuration management using Webpack and ESLint.  

### Key goals:

- Implement interfaces, classes, and types in TypeScript  
- Use Webpack for bundling and build automation  
- Enforce code quality with ESLint  
- Render dynamic content on the DOM using Vanilla JavaScript

- **`task_0`** — contains the first task demonstrating TypeScript interfaces and DOM manipulation  
- Each task folder follows a similar pattern with isolated configuration

# Setup and Installation

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v14 or higher recommended)  
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) (comes bundled with Node.js)

From the root of the task folder (e.g., `0x04-TypeScript/task_0`)
##### run:
npm install

## Build the project
To compile TypeScript and bundle with Webpack:
npm run build
Run a development server (optional)
If your config supports it, start a live-reload server:
npm start
Usage
Open dist/index.html in your browser after build to see the rendered output

Modify the TypeScript files in js/ and rebuild to update your project
